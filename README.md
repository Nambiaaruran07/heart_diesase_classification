# Heart Disease Prediction Project

This project utilizes machine learning models to predict the presence of heart disease based on various health-related features. The models are trained using a dataset containing patient information, and predictions can be made using new input values.

# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can determine whether a patient has heart disease based on their health metrics. The project implements three different machine learning algorithms:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),
Logistic Regression ,
Random Forest Classifier

# Installation
To set up this project, you need to install the required packages. It is recommended to create a virtual environment for better dependency management.

 # Install Required Packages
 
```
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib
```
